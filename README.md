After some issues I finally managed to get everything working. A big roadblock was the names of the files, I know I'm supposed to have the files all have my name and class in them, but doing that led to issues in my java code reading the other files due to class limitations/pickiness. So I opted to just leave them short, but if I really really need to correct them I will. Also It wasn't clear to me whether or not I was supposed to program the files to be openly and have inputs and all that, I just made some example problems directly in the code instead. And after compiling created the output.txt file to show the outputs, I had extra time so I made sure the outputs were organized as well to make up for it. If there is anything else I'm missing, please tell me right away and I will fix it!!!
